# 📊 NumPy

NumPy is the backbone of scientific computing in Python.  
This folder is my personal learning space where I practice, break, rebuild,  
and slowly understand how data actually moves.

## 🚀 What I’m Learning
- NumPy arrays & data types  
- Indexing, slicing & fancy slicing  
- Array operations & broadcasting  
- Mathematical and statistical functions  
- Real-world data handling basics

## 🧠 Why NumPy?
Because raw Python lists are slow.  
NumPy is fast, memory-efficient, and built for scale —  
the first real step into Data Science, ML, and AI.
